        <h1 class="main-heading">Why Conditioner is Must in Hair Care Routine?
        </h1>
        <p>Do you also wonder if conditioner is truly important? And the answer is yes! Conditioner is absolutely essential to get silky, shiny, and healthy tresses. A study conducted by the Indian Journal of Dermatology explains that hair conditioners help to improve hair manageability while adding natural shine and luster to your hair. 

            <br>A variety of factors such as weather changes, environmental pollution, heating tools, strong chemicals, etc weigh your hair down. This makes you struggle with rough, dull, and damaged hair. 
            
            <br>We understand that looking after your hair can certainly be maddening. Put your worries aside as we have formulated the perfect guide for you.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">What is a hair conditioner?</h2>
        <p>Hair conditioner is a hair care product that helps to hydrate and nourish your hair to make them look healthier, softer, and silkier. Hair conditioners are formulated using hydrating and moisturising ingredients that penetrate your hair shaft and inner layers of hair to restore moisture.  

            <br>As per hair care experts, the use of conditioners after shampoo is highly essential to prevent dry, frizzy, and damaged hair. Conditioner helps to replenish the moisture and oil contents that are lost due to shampooing.
            
            </p>
        <h1 class="main-heading">Types of conditioners</h1>
        <p>Before you jump into buying a bottle of conditioner for your hair, you should know about the type of conditioner you need to suit your hair type and routine. Let’s begin.
         </p>
        <h2 class="heading">1. Deep Conditioner</h2>
        <p>As the name implies, deep conditioners offer hydration to the deeper layers of your hair. Such types of conditioners are considered ideal to repair chemically treated, colored, and heated damaged hair. It has been figured out that Babassu-based conditioners provide satisfactory results for achieving soft, shiny, and healthy hair. 

        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">2. Cleansing Conditioner</h2>
        <p>It is also known as CO Washing or conditioner-only washing or no-poo method. Cleansing conditioners are considered an integral part of curly hair care.

            <br>In co-washing, curly hair people use conditioner to wash their tresses instead of shampoo. As per hair care experts, murumuru butter is quite good to nourish curly hair types.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">3. Leave-In Conditioner</h2>
        <p>These conditioners are formulated using gentle and natural hydrating ingredients that form a protective coating around your strand meanwhile improving hair texture.

            <br>The major benefit of leave-in conditioners is they protect your hair from all the external damage like sun rays, pollution, and changing weather.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">4. Dry Conditioner</h2>
        <p>A dry conditioner usually contains oil and aerosol. They help to hydrate and add shine without wetting your hair.

        </p>
        <h1 class="main-heading">What Is the Proper Way to Use Conditioner?</h1>
        <p>Whether you have color-treated hair, frizzy hair, or find yourself heat styling your hair often, using conditioner is a key to healthy hair. But using it right is just as important as having the right formula for your hair needs. Adopt these tips below to ensure that you are making the most of your conditioner.  
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">1. Apply It to Your Lengths and Ends Only</h2>
        <p>It’s a good idea to apply conditioner only where it’s needed the most, for example, your mid-lengths to your ends since this part of your hair tends to be drier. Applying conditioner at your roots can weigh down your hair and cause your roots to appear greasy, even right after you’ve washed your hair. To avoid both, it’s best to only apply conditioner on your lengths and ends.

        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">2. Leave It On Long Enough to Be Effective</h2>
        <p>If you apply your conditioner only to rinse it off immediately, you may not be reaping all of its benefits. Typically, you’ll want to leave the conditioner on for the amount of time listed in the directions on the packaging, which is usually between one and three minutes — just enough time to wash your face.

        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">3. Apply the Recommended Amount</h2>
        <p>Before you go squirting half a bottle of conditioner into your hands post-shampoo, hear us out: When it comes to conditioner, less is definitely more — especially if you have fine hair. When you use too much, it can potentially make your hair look weighed down. A good rule of thumb is to use one or two quarter-sized dollops of conditioner, depending on the thickness and length of your hair. When in doubt, check the product packaging for recommended usage amount before you get started.
