        <h1 class="main-heading">Best skin care tips for sensitive skin:</h1>
        <p>
            Having sensitive skin can be tough. It might feel like whenever you put anything on your face, 
            your skin is rebelling. No matter what new makeup, scrub, or product you try to use, you just cannot 
            win. Here are some tips to soothe your sensitive skin so you can learn to pamper your skin and avoid 
            irritation.
            Soon you will have healthy and glowing skin.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Get back to basics</h1>
        <p>Most skincare tips for sensitive skin can be summed up in one principal: keep things simple.
             Starting with your cleanser, forget harsh chemicals that can upset your skin and rather 
             look for products that soothe. Skincare can actually have the opposite effect if you overdo 
             it! Squeaky-clean is not how you want your skin to feel ­– we’re after gently cleansed and 
             refreshed. Simplify your skincare kit with products like our Simple® Water Boost Micellar 
             Cleansing Water , which doesn’t dry out skin but removes daily dead skin cells, impurities, 
             and excess oil, gently.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Handle your skin with care</h1>
        <p>We can be a bit harsh when we cleanse. Without realising, rubbing, tugging, and even drying 
            post-cleanse can make skin more sensitive. Linger a bit longer when you’re removing make-up.
            Using a cotton pad soaked in eye make-up remover, hold it over your eye a little longer and 
            it’ll have more time to dissolve stubborn make-up to sweep it away in a flash!
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Cool down your skin</h1>
        <p>Excess heat can unsettle sensitive skin, so stick to lukewarm water to wash your face and 
            avoid very hot showers. If you feel your skin needs some cooling down, pop a damp face cloth 
            in the fridge to use as a cooling compress on irritated skin. 
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Protect your face against pollution </h1>
        <p>Throughout the day, pollution in the air can stick to your skin and damage your skin’s 
            barrier. Over time, these particles can build up on your skin and can lead to irritation. 
            Our suggestion? Cleanse often, at the beginning and the end of each day, to remove dirt and 
            impurities. Out and about? Keep a pack of cleansing wipes in your bag for on-the-go cleansing.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Makeup Regime</h1>
        <p>You can still wear make up! Just because your skin is delicate does not mean you have to toss
             away all make up. Use a mineral powder or silicone-based foundation to lessen the 
             likelihood of irritation. Avoid waterproof mascara since it requires a harsh cleanser to 
             remove it. Use eyeliner in pencil form, not liquid. Liquids often contain latex and may 
             cause irritation. Clean your make up brushes regularly and get rid of any old make up.   
        </p>
