        <h1 class="main-heading">Best skin care tips for Normal skin:</h1>
        <p>So, you’ve got “normal” skin? Lucky you! Normal skin is one of the lower maintenance skin types. 
            It typically doesn’t require much work to prevent excess oiliness, sensitivity, or dryness.
            However, there are still some steps you can take to ensure your skin looks and feels its best.
            Normal skin may mostly come down to genetics.
            Just like your eye and hair color, you’re born with certain genes that influence your skin type.
            However, hormone levels, stress, too much sun exposure, and certain products can upset the skin’s balance, ultimately leading to a change in skin type.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Less is more</h1>
        <p>Koukoufikis says less is more when it comes to creating a skin care routine for normal skin.
            “It’s vital to keep it balanced. Don’t use products that strip the skin,
            as this will encourage it to produce more sebum,” she explains.
            Similarly, overmoisturizing can prevent the skin from producing its own natural moisturizing factors.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Apply sunscreen every day before you go outdoors</h1>
        <p> Sunscreen is the closest thing we have to a fountain of youth. It really can slow down skin aging.
         It can also help prevent skin cancer.
         Look for a sunscreen that offers broad-spectrum protection, SPF 30 (or higher), and water resistance.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Stress less</h1>
        <p>Finding healthy ways to manage stress can help your skin, too. Some skin diseases like psoriasis and atopic
         dermatitis (eczema) often appear for the first time when someone feels really stressed.
         Stress can also cause flare-ups of many skin conditions, including acne, eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Gently wash your face</h1>
        <p>Gentle cleansing helps skin look its best. To gently cleanse your face, wet it with lukewarm water.
         Then apply a mild cleanser, gently applying the cleanser in a circular motion with your fingertips.
         Finish by completely rinsing off the cleanser and gently patting your face dry with a clean towel.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Check your skin regularly</h1>
        <p>Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S., affecting one in five Americans in their lifetime.
             Further, nearly 20 Americans die from melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, every day.
             However, when detected early, skin cancer—including melanoma—is highly treatable.
             In fact, the five-year survival rate for people whose melanoma is detected and treated before it spreads to the lymph nodes is 98%.
             It is important to check your skin regularly for new spots, spots that are different from other spots on your body,
             or moles that itch, bleed or change color, as these are often early warning signs of skin cancer.
             If you notice any suspicious spots, make an appointment to see a board-certified dermatologist.
