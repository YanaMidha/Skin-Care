        <h1 class="main-heading">Philautia means "Self Love"</h1>
        <p>We want you to love yourself. A tiny exceptional percentage of people look at selfcare as an important aspect of life. Skincare is fundamental health and like all domains of our life, it's progress that matters here and not perfection. You're in here, and it's not by chance.
            Skincare is the ultimate Self-love.
             </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Remember,You are not looking at buying products but investing in
            your Skin.</h1>
        <p>Philautiya is built with honesty and empathy at its core. We offer solutions that you can trust and ritualise. We believe that you deserve to have healthy skin and hair because that makes you look good and more importantly, it makes you feel better.
            We are consumers first and we understand the hope, time and money our customers invest in us.

            <br>All our products are dermatologically tested by leading labs for safety against any skin allergies, reaction or inflammation and for efficacy. The Clinical Tests are conducted under the supervision of dermatologists.
            
            
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">"Everything is a chemical – water is a chemical – therefore, chemical-free products don’t exist."</h1>
        <p>We wanted to address this issue of lack of transparency through a range of products that are straightforward, honest and do what they claim to do. No unnecessary marketing fluff. And this is how 
            Philautiya was born.</p>
        
        <h1 class="heading">Bringing The "Care" Back to Skincare</h1>
        <p>Our nature-forward approach to formulation ensures our ingredients and actives are in their most natural skin-friendly usable form. We take every precaution to eliminate anything that has the smallest chance to adversely affect your body and our environment. 
            Every one of our products are tested clinically to ensure 100% dermatological safety.
        </p>
        <p><br>Skincare is self-care and rightly so. After all, the skin is the largest organ in the human body. It performs many important functions, including protecting the body from external damage, regulating temperature, and providing sensory information.
             Thus, it is extremely important to take care of your skin, because healthy skin means healthy you!</p>
