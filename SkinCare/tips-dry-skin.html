        <h1 class="main-heading">Best skin care tips for dry skin:</h1>
        <h1 class="heading">Gently wash your face at least twice a day</h1>
        <p>Use a gentle, alcohol-free, nonfoaming cleanser on your face twice a day and after sweating. 
            Products with stearic acid (found in shea butter) or linoleic acid (found in argan oil and others) can help repair your skin.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Use warm water and limit bath time</h1>
        <p>Long showers or baths and hot water remove your skin's natural oils. 
            Limit bathing to no more than once a day and no longer than 5-10 minutes. 
            Use warm, not hot, water.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Use allergen-free moisturizing soap</h1>
        <p>For handwashing, use fragrance-free (hypoallergenic) moisturizing soap.
             Then apply a moisturizing cream while your hands are still damp.
             In the shower or bath, try a nonsoap cleansing cream or shower gel,
              and use soap only in areas where needed, such as the armpits and groin.
              Avoid loofahs and pumice stones. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Apply moisturizer immediately after washing</h1>
        <p> Ointments, creams, and lotions (moisturizers) work by trapping existing moisture in your skin.
             To trap this much-needed moisture,
             you need to apply a moisturizer within few minutes of, Drying off after a shower or bath
             and also after washing your face or hands.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Use a humidifier</h1>
        <p>Dry skin needs moisture. You can boost the humidity level in your home with a humidifier.
         Some home heating systems have a humidifier. You can also use a portable humidifier.
         If you use a portable humidifier, place it in your bedroom and run it while you sleep.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Avoid the sun and tanning beds</h1>
        <p>Both the sun and indoor tanning equipment emit UV rays, which dry the skin.
         To protect your skin from the sun, seek shade. You also want to wear clothing that protects your skin,
          such as a wide-brimmed hat, long sleeves, and pants. For any skin that clothing will not cover,
             apply a fragrance-free sunscreen that offers broad-spectrum protection and SPF 30 or higher.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Wear loose-fitting cotton clothes</h1>
        <p> Tight clothes, such as leggings and body-hugging jeans, rub against your skin, which can worsen dry skin.
             Wearing clothing made of wool or polyester against your skin can also irritate dry, sensitive skin.
             To prevent irritating your skin, wear loose-fitting cotton clothing.
