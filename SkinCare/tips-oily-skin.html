        <h1 class="main-heading">Best skin care tips for oily skin:</h1>
        <h1 class="heading">Wash your face twice a day</h1>
        <p>Cleanse, cleanse, and cleanse! The most effective way to reduce excess oil from your skin is to cleanse your face twice a day.
             Use warm water to wash your face, cleansing once in the morning and once at night. 
             Doing so removes the accumulated dirt and oil particles from your skin. Remember to wash your face with gentle soap.
             You can pick up something that is glycerine-based since it is very gentle on the skin.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Avoid touching your face constantly</h1>
        <p>If you have an oily skin type, breakouts and blemishes now and then are nothing new.
             However, you must avoid popping or picking any pimples to prevent further spreading
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Maintain a healthy diet</h1>
        <p>You might enjoy food that is spicy, sweet and fried but if your skin is oily, avoid such foods.
             Processed foods and dairy products can also deteriorate your skin health.
              Make sure you’re getting enough vitamins and minerals.
               For that, you should add more fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, meats, eggs,
                and pulses to your diet.
             Following an oil-free diet can help you fight against oily skin.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Drink plenty of water</h1>
        <p>Drink plenty of water in a day. You should consume at least 7 to 8 glasses of water to
             flush out toxins and keep your skin hydrated.
             Enough water in the body helps prevent excess production of sebum and oil.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Moisturize regularly</h1>
        <p>Moisturizing regularly will keep your skin hydrated and prevent it from overproducing sebum.
             Choosing the right moisturizer is important.
             A lotion-based, lightweight moisturizer is advised for oily skin types.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Makeup Regime</h1>
        <p>Avoid using chemical-laden, thick skincare products and ingredients. 
            Instead look for non-comedogenic makeup products that won’t clog pores.
             Also, use gentle cleansers and don't scrub.
             Make sure you remove all your makeup residue before hitting the bed.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">Use a facial mask</h1>
        <p>Certain facial masks may be beneficial for treating oily skin. 
            These may contain ingredients such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Clay. Masks containing minerals like smectite or bentonite can absorb
                     oils and reduce skin shininess and sebum levels without irritating the skin.
                      Use them only occasionally to prevent the skin drying out,
                     and apply a gentle moisturizer afterward.</li>
                <li>Honey, A 2011 study shows that natural raw honey has antibacterial and antiseptic
                     qualities. A 10-minute honey face mask may reduce acne and oily skin while keeping
                      the skin soft.
                </li>
                <li>Milk & Oatmeal, Masks containing colloidal oatmeal may help to cleanse the skin, as suggested in a 2014
                     study. Oats contain gentle, cleansing saponins, antioxidants, 
                    and anti-inflammatory compounds that could soothe irritated skin.</li>
              </ul>
        </p>
